# ISD_ShippingCountryNotice

Magento 2 module, which provides ability to add a message with HTML tags below form fields on checkout page

I created this repo to host code related to my blog post: https://www.backarapper.com/how-to-add-html-tags-in-notice-section-of-checkout-form-fields-in-magento-2/

This module tested with Magento version 2.2.3

Please comment in blog post if you need any help or clarity regarding this code. 

Thanks :)
